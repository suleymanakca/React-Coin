# React-Coin
  Using React, I built an CoinApp

  This app gives informations about 100 coins.
  This informations are rank, price, market cap and 24H change of the coins. 

  The app consists of two parts.
  The former represents the coins with some informations at the in 5 five page.
  The latter represents the detailed informations about coins by clicking coins on the table or searching the coin you want. At the detaied page, there are some extra informations such as total supply and 24H volume.
  
  I get the datas from Udilia Cryptocurrencies JSON API(https://udilia.com/docs/cryptocurrencies/v1)

  I built this app with the help of Dimi Mikadze's course on Udemy.(https://www.udemy.com/learn-react-by-building-and-deploying-production-ready-app/)

  But this app have some problems while using as I saw: 
  
1.The search list at the header is stil on working at the main page when the user click a coin on the coin-table.
The search bar should be cleared.

2.The search list at the header is stil on working at the detailed page when the user clicks on the React image at the top-left that        directs the app to the main page.

  I am trying to figure out the problems.
